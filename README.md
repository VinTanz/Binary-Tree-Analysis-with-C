# Binary Tree Analysis in C

This project focuses on the analysis of binary trees using the C programming language. 

## Features
- Implementation of basic binary tree operations.
- Analysis of traversal methods such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
- Exploration of algorithms like insertion, deletion, and search.
- Efficiency analysis of various tree operations.
